This is a very stupid code. You will need to change the code structure and a few things. 
I will see your coding skills(code quality, making function, and variable names, etc.)

1. After adding new food, reports should be sorted from the latest one. 
2. After adding a new one, clear form fields. 
3. Filtering is not working properly for some specific days. 
4. In the Admin side, remove the "DETAILS" button and add a table to show the report page. 

	No | User  |		 The Last 7 Days    		|  The Week Before	    
        	     Number of Entries | Average Daily Calories	   Number of Entries
		     Current Day: 				   Current Day: 
	1   User1         x			x   			  x
	2   User2         x			x 			  x
	3   User3         x			x 			  x
	... ... 

5. The limit threshold is 2100, it's the default value. 
Currently, all users can't add more than 2100 as the limit value is 2100. 
But I just want to make that all users can add more than 2100 and Ensure the users can see for which day they reached that limit. 
Also, the admin can change the threshold in the DB per user. 
6. Split components(Home.js, AdminHome.js), each file should have around 150 - 200 lines. 
7. Remove unnecessary code. 
8. Change the folder structure, function and variable names. 
9. Fix all console bugs and warnings.
