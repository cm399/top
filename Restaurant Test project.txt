Write a single-page application to Review Restaurants using React. 

1. Implement 3 roles with different permission levels
    * Regular User: Can rate and leave a comment for a restaurant
    * Owner: Can create restaurants and reply to comments about owned restaurants
    * Admin: Can edit/delete all users, restaurants, comments, and reviews
2. Reviews should have:
    * A 5 star based rating
    * Date of the visit
    * Comment 
3. When a Regular User logs in, they will see a Restaurant List ordered by Average Rating
4. When an Owner logs in, they will see a Restaurant List - only the ones owned by them, and the reviews pending reply
5. Owners can reply to each review once
6. Restaurants detailed view should have:
    * The overall average rating
    * The highest rated review
    * The lowest rated review
    * Last reviews with rate, comment, and reply
7. Restaurant List can be filtered by Rating
8. RESTful API. Make it possible to perform all user actions via the API, including authentication. Use Postman, cURL, etc. for this purpose.
9. All actions need to be done client-side using AJAX, refreshing the page is not acceptable. 
10. Functional UI/UX design is needed. You are not required to create a unique design, however, do follow best practices to make the project as functional as possible.

Bonus: unit and e2e tests.

Please provide the result as a github repo and a video working on Postman, cURL, etc. 

Thanks
